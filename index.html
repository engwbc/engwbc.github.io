    <ul>
        <li>Contributed to Genomics Thailand (GeTH), an extensive collaborative research network to enable precision medicine.</li>
        <li>Worked on GeTH projects to integrate genomic medicine to clinical services by developing a digital database for diseases and characterising pharmacogenes:
            <ul>
                <li>Ran genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to explore genetic variants linked with drug-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and adverse events following immunisation (AEFI).</li>
                <li>Performed Mycobacterium tuberculosis structural variation (SV) analysis using multiple SV callers (IMSindel, Manta) and GATK4 for single nucleotide variation (SNV) calling.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with medical scientists and curated BRCA1/2 variants based on guidelines provided by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2018) to construct a database for Thai breast cancer variants.</li>
                <li>Developed and deployed pipelines to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scaling up demanding computational tasks, such as large GWAS analyses (>1,000 samples and >900,000 SNPs).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    Dissertation supervised by Prof Rafael Carazo-Salas.<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Applied image segmentation and classification methods for tracking individual human pluripotent stem cells to map differentiation pathways.</li>
        <li>Extracted biological features to predict differentiation characteristics, such as differentiation marker expression, cell cycle length, cell migration distance and cell velocity.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Ministry of Public Health, Thailand (2021)</strong><br>  
    Internship supervised by Dr Surakameth Mahasirimongkol.<br>
