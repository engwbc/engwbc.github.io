## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Ministry of Public Health, Thailand (2024 - Present)** <br>
Research Intern at the Department of Medical Sciences<br> 
Supervised by Dr Surakameth Mahasirimongkol.
* Contributed to Genomics Thailand (GeTH), an extensive collaborative research network to enable precision medicine.
* Worked on projects in the second phase of GeTH which aims to integrate genomic medicine to clinical services by developing a digital genomic database and predicting drug response based on pharmacogenes: 
  * Ran genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to explore genetic variants linked with drug-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and adverse events following immunisation (AEFI).
  * Performed Mycobacterium tuberculosis structural variation (SV) analysis using multiple SV callers (IMSindel, Manta) and GATK 4 for single nucleotide variation (SNV) calling.
  * Interpreted BRCA1/2 variants based on guidelines provided by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) to establish a Thai breast cancer variant database.
  * Conducted a proof of concept for the implementation of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support and accelerate demanding computational tasks, such as large GWAS datasets (>1,000 samples and >500,000 SNPs). <br>

**University of York, UK (2023)** <br>
Research project supervised by Prof Jeremy Mottram & Dr Joana Faria. 
* Utilised precision gene editing to characterise a putative RNA:DNA helicase in Leishmania mexicana.
* Use of bioinformatic tools (MAFFT, HMMER) to obtain protein predictions and AlphaFold2 for structural analysis. <br>

**University of Bristol, UK (2022)** <br>
Dissertation supervised by Prof Rafael Carazo-Salas. 
* Experimented with image segmentation and classification techniques for tracking individual human pluripotent stem cells to map differentiation pathways.
* Extracted biological features to predict differentiation characteristics, such as differentiation marker expression, cell cycle length, cell migration distance and cell velocity. <br>

**Ministry of Public Health, Thailand (2021)** <br>	
Summer internship supervised by Dr Surakameth Mahasirimongkol.
* Conducted genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins, to monitor viral evolution in Thailand.
